    👋 Hi, I’m Wona - currently a student studying Informatics in Oslo. 
    <br>I also have a background in Classics and am a Hellenist 🏛️.
    <br>I'm a fantasy nerd, a lover of languages, a knitter, and a converted cat-person 💞️.

  I am currently working on a hobby project called hexametron - a tool that analyzes dactylic hexameter in Ancient Greek. I'm hoping to develop this project with a GUI and cool features. I also want to learn a new language ⭐. And get a summer job.

🌱 I’m currently seeking a (summer) job!
