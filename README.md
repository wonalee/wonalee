    👋 Hi, I’m Wona - a student studying Informatics in Oslo. 
    <br>I also have a background in Classics and am a Hellenist 🏛️.
    <br>I'm a fantasy nerd, a lover of languages, a knitter, and a converted cat-person 💞️.

<b>:telescope: 2024 goal</b>
<br>I am currently working on a hobby project called hexametron which stemmed from my interest in languages - it is a tool that analyzes dactylic hexameter in Ancient Greek. I'm hoping to develop this project further with a GUI. I also want to learn a new language ⭐. 


🌱 I’m seeking a (summer) job!
